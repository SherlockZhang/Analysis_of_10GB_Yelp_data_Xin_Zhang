# Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data

I analyzed a subset of Yelp's business, reviews and user data. This dataset comes to us from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) and I upload this data into a publis s3 bucket: 
`s3://sta9760-spark-datasets2/*business.json`
`s3://sta9760-spark-datasets2/*review.json`
`s3://sta9760-spark-datasets2/*user.json`

S3 pages are also here.

Note that the output of the code written is provided as a means to give you structure as you write your analysis. For **Parts I, II & III**, you must fill in the blanks (however way you want) to get the output provided in the file. (Mainly columns and aggregations, I don't care about the exact rows). For **Parts III and IV**, you are more flexibility to take the analysis further however you see fit.
